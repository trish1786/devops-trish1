Lab 1: Use terraform to setup the docker server and jenkins server for CICD Lab
###############################################################################

# Launch Ubuntu 20.04 t2.micro EC2 machine.
# Note: In the security group, open ports 22, 80, 8080, 9999 and 4243. 
# Use the EC2 tag "CICDLab-yourname'

Task 1: Install Terraform
=========================
# After the EC2 server is up & running, SSH into the machine and do the below:

sudo hostnamectl set-hostname CICDLab
exit 
SSH into the machine again. New hostname will appear now
or 
type bash 

sudo apt update
sudo apt install wget unzip -y

wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/1.11.3/terraform_1.11.3_linux_amd64.zip
unzip terraform_1.11.3_linux_amd64.zip

ls
sudo mv terraform /usr/local/bin
ls
terraform -v

Task 2: Install AWS CLI and Ansible
===================================
sudo apt-get install python3-pip -y
sudo pip3 install awscli boto boto3 ansible 
aws configure         # will ask access and secreate key 
Example:
Access Key ID:
Secret Access Key:

# If you need to create new credentials, Follow below steps
#Go to aws console. On top right corner, click on your name or aws profile id. 
#when the menu opens, click on Security Credentials
#Under AWS IAM Credntials, click on Create access key. If you already have 2 active keys, 
#you can deactivate and delete the older one so that you can create a new key
#Complete aws configure step

# do smoke test to check if your credentials are valid
aws s3 ls

# Create hosts inventory file with the necessary permissions
 sudo mkdir /etc/ansible && sudo touch /etc/ansible/hosts
 sudo chmod 766 /etc/ansible/hosts


Task 3: Use terraform to launch 2 servers. 
==========================================
# We need 2 additional servers docker-server and jenkins-server
# For git-ws, we will use the anchor EC2 (from where we are operating now) 
# You can use t2.micro for Docker/Jenkins

# Create the terraform directory and set up the config files in it
mkdir devops-labs && cd devops-labs

# As a first step, create a key using ssh-keygen.
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 

# Basically just hit 'Enter' key for the 3 questions it asks
# Now prepare the terraform config files.
vi DevOpsServers.tf         # add the following content in the file.

provider "aws" {
  region = var.region
}

resource "aws_key_pair" "mykeypair" {
  key_name   = var.key_name
  public_key = file(var.public_key)
}

# to create 2 EC2 instances
resource "aws_instance" "my-machine" {
  # Launch 2 servers
  for_each = toset(var.my-servers)

  ami                    = var.ami_id
  key_name               = var.key_name
  vpc_security_group_ids = [var.sg_id]
  instance_type          = var.ins_type

  # Read from the list my-servers to name each server
  tags = {
    Name = each.key
  }

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = <<-EOT
      echo [${each.key}] >> /etc/ansible/hosts
      echo ${self.public_ip} >> /etc/ansible/hosts
    EOT
  }
}


# save the ablove file :wq -enter
# Now, create the variables file with all variables to be used in the main config file.

vi variables.tf

variable "region" {
  default = "us-east-1"
}

# Change the SG ID. You can use the same SG ID used for your CICD anchor server
# Basically the SG should open ports 22, 80, 8080, 9999, and 4243
variable "sg_id" {
  default = "sg-07d42a9b8e4d7f966" # us-east-1
}

# Choose a free tier Ubuntu AMI. You can use below.
variable "ami_id" {
  default = "ami-04505e74c0741db8d" # us-east-1; Ubuntu
}

# We are only using t2.micro for this lab
variable "ins_type" {
  default = "t2.micro"
}

# Replace 'yourname' with your first name
variable "key_name" {
  default = "test-CICDlab-KeyPair"
}

variable "public_key" {
  default = "/home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa.pub" #Ubuntu OS
}

variable "my-servers" {
  type    = list(string)
  default = ["jenkins-server", "docker-server"]
}

# save the file :wq -enter
# Edit the security group id and keyname in variables.tf

# Now, execute the terraform config files to launch the servers

terraform init
terraform fmt
terraform validate
terraform plan
terraform apply -auto-approve

# After the terraform code is executed, check hosts inventory file and ensure below output (sample)
sudo vi /etc/ansible/hosts
# It will show ip addresses of jenkins server and docker server as below 
# add the ansible private key as belwo.
# example: add the keypaid path also

[docker-server]
54.209.238.152    ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/home/ubuntu/devops-labs/mykey
[jenkins-server]
34.228.155.75     ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/home/ubuntu/devops-labs/mykey


#save the file :wq  -enter
# Now ssh into docker-server & jenkins-server and check they are accessible
ssh ubuntu@<Jenkins ip address>
# Set the hostname
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname Jenkins

ssh ubuntu@<Docker ip address>  
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname Docker



Task 4: Use Ansible to deploy respective packages into each of the 3 servers 
============================================================================
cd ~
mkdir ansible && cd ansible

# Create a file and copy all the content in the file save it and run the playbook

#####################
Lab 2: Git operations
#####################

Crteate the github repository based on the method shown in the course document
Create an empty repository in your github account. Name = hello-world

After that, lets operate in local Git repository


Initializing the local git repository and committing changes
============================================================
# On the CICD anchor EC2, do the below:
cd ~/
# Check GIT version. 
git --version
# If it does not exist, then you can install with below command. Else no need to execute below 
# line:  sudo apt install git -y

# Download the Java code we are going to use in the CICD pipeline
# wget https://devops-e-e.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/hello-world-master.zip
wget https://hsbctraining.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/hello-world-master.zip
unzip hello-world-master.zip
ls
rm hello-world-master.zip
cd hello-world-master
ls

git init .

# Check the email and user name configured.
git config user.email
git config user.name

# If you need to change it, you can use below:
git config --global user.email "< Add your email >"
git config --global user.name "< Add your Name >"

git status
git add .
git status

git log
git commit -m "This is the first commit"
git log
git status

git remote add origin < Replace your Repository URL > 
# Ex: git remote add origin https://github.com/martuj/hello-world.git

git remote add origin https://github.com/martuj/hello-world.git

git remote show origin



Task 3: Pushing the Code into your Remote GitHub Repository  
===========================================================
# To push code to Github, You need to generate a Personal Access Token (PAT) in github.
# Go to your Github homepage. Click on settings in right side top menu. Click on Developer settings on 
# left side menu bottom. Click on Personal Access Token on left side menu. Click on Generate New Token
# Under 'Select Scopes' select all items. Click on 'generate token'. Copy the token

git push origin master 
# when it asks for password, enter the PAT Token
Token: <enter your PAT> 
ghp_I5pAGdGG0v4UdA # Use your respective PAT
# When you enter the token, the cursor does not move. It's the expected behavior
 

Task 4: Creating a Git Branch and Pushing into the Remote Repository  
====================================================================
git branch dev
git branch
git checkout dev
git branch

vi index.html

# Press INSERT and add the below content

<html>
<body>
<h1> Hi There! This file is added in dev branch </h1>
</body>
</html>

# Save vi using ESCAPE + :wq!

git status
git add index.html
git status

git commit -m "adding new file index.html in new branch dev"
git log

git push origin dev
when it asks for password, enter PAT Token
Token: <your PAT>

git branch
git branch prod
git branch
git checkout prod
git branch
git merge dev
git push origin prod

Token: <PAT>

git checkout master
git merge prod
git push origin master



##################################################################################
After this, you have to complete Jenkins setup and Docker setup. You can refer to 
the course document which gives screenshots 
##################################################################################

###############################
Lab 3: Configure Jenkins
###############################

# Copy private key to Jenkins server so that we can SSH into docker server from jenkins server

ansible jenkins-server -m copy -a "src=/home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa dest=/home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa" -b
ansible docker-server -m copy -a "src=/home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa dest=/home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa" -b

# SSH into the Jenkins server and get the initial password for Jenkins
ssh ubuntu@3.93.145.99
sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword

afbe8d33e25b4b908c0b9f91546f09e6

# Now, go to the browser and enter Jenkins URL

http://54.227.66.155:8080/

# Under Unlock Jenkins, enter the above Initial password. Continue.
Click on Install suggested Plugins on Customize Jenkins page.

# Once the plugins are installed, it gives you the page where you can create new admin user id 
# and password. 

Enter user id and password. Save & Continue. 
# To keep things easier for this training, you may use the same user
# id and password which you used for Github. Needless to say, in real life, you must keep the user 
# ids and passwords separate.

In next step, on Instance Configuration Page, verify your Jenkins Public IP and Port Number then 
click on Save and Finish
------------------------------
# You will be prompted to the Jenkins Home Page

Click on Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins

Under Manage Plugins, go to the Available tab and search for Maven. Select the Maven Integration 
Plugin and Unleash Maven Plugin and click Install without restart

Once the installation is completed, click on Go back to the top page

After going back to the Home Page select Manage Jenkins and go to Global Tool Configuration

Inside Global Tool Configuration, look for Maven, and under Maven installations, click Add Maven. 
Give the Name as Maven, choose Version as 3.8.4 and Save the configuration

Now you need to make a project for your application build, for that select New Item from the 
Home Page of Jenkins

Enter an item name as hello-world and select the project as Maven Project and then click OK

After you click on OK, you will be prompted to the configure page inside hello-world project. 
Go to Source Code Management tab, select Source Code Management as Git You need to provide the 
GitHub Repository URL and GitHub Account Credentials. In the Credentials field, you have to 
click Add then click on Jenkins.

Then you will get prompted to Jenkins Credentials Provider page of Jenkins. Under Add Credentials, 
you can add your GitHub Username, Password and Description. Then click on Add

After returning to the Source Code Management Page, click on Credentials and Choose your 
GitHub Credentials.

Keep all the other values as default and select Build Tab and inside Goals and options put a 
line as a clean package and save the configuration by clicking on Save.

# 'clean package' command clears the target directory and Builds the project and packages the 
# resulting JAR file into the target directory.

You will get back to Maven project hello-world click on Build Now for building the .war file 
for your application

# You can go to Workspace > dist folder to see that the .war file is created there.
# war file will be created in /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/hello-world/target/


Task 2: Installing and Configuring Tomcat for Deploying our Application on Jenkins server
=========================================================================================

# SSH into Jenkins server. Make sure that you are root user and Install Tomcat web server
ssh ubuntu@3.87.66.176 # If you are already in Jenkins, this step not needed

sudo apt update

sudo apt install tomcat9 tomcat9-admin -y
# ss -ltn

sudo systemctl enable tomcat9

# Now we need to navigate to server.xml to change the Tomcat port number from 8080 to 9999, 
# as port number 8080 is already being used by Jenkins website.
sudo vi /etc/tomcat9/server.xml
#Change 8080 to 9999 in 1 place. (There are 2 other references in comments)
press esc
:g/8080/s//9999/g  hit enter
/9999 hit enter to verify


#Now restart the system for the changes to take effect
sudo service tomcat9 restart
sudo service tomcat9 status

# Once the Tomcat service restart is successful, go to your web browser and enter Jenkins
# Server IP address followed by 9999 port, you can check the Tomcat running on port 9999 
# on the same machine. http://< Your Jenkins Public IP >:9999
http://184.72.112.155:9999
 
# We need to copy the .war file created in the previous Jenkins build from Jenkins workspace 
# to tomcat webapps directory to serve the web content

sudo cp -R /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/hello-world/target/hello-world-war-1.0.0.war /var/lib/tomcat9/webapps

# Once this is done, go to your browser and enter Jenkins Server Public IP address followed 
# by port 9999 and path â€˜hello-world-war-1.0.0â€™ and you can see tomcat is now serving your web page
# (URL:  http://< Your Jenkins Public IP >:9999/hello-world-war-1.0.0/)

http://184.72.112.155:9999/hello-world-war-1.0.0/

# Stop tomcat9 and remove it. Else it will slow down Jenkins
sudo service tomcat9 stop
sudo apt remove tomcat9 -y
